# TradeGuard
TradeGuard is a lightweight Python tool for simulating simplified trading workflows. It ingests trade data and market prices, calculates mark-to-market profit and loss (P&amp;L), and applies simple risk checks. The goal is to provide a minimal example of how analysts might monitor trades and exposures in real markets.
